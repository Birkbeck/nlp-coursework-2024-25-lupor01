#Re-assessment template 2025
#just a line for first commit..let's see if it works...
# still trying to see if commiting/pushing works..


# Note: The template functions here and the dataframe format for structuring your solution is a suggested but not mandatory approach. You can use a different approach if you like, as long as you clearly answer the questions and communicate your answers clearly.

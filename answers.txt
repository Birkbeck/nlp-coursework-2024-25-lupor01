Answers to the text questions go here.

PART 1, Flesch-Kincaid
Firstly, FK may produce poor estimates due to the unreliability of syllable
number as a proxy for word difficulty. Longer words tend to refer to more
complex concepts. However, this is not always true.
Higer-level words may be short – e.g., forte, leer, prone - whereas
longer words may be relatively well-known – e.g., democracy, consequence.
Poetry and technical content rich in uncommon short words might yield low FK,
while actually simple texts with lots of common long words may score higher. 

Secondly, FK may be unrealiable when analysing transcribed speech. The formula
relies on number of sentences, and when punctuation is added a posteriori,
it influences the resulting estimation. In fact, the same text will correspond
to different FK scores depending on punctuation choices – i.e., resulting 
sentence length.
